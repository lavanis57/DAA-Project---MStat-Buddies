Project Report (project.pdf) discusses in detail the logic behind the algorithm and its psuedocode with a visual representation. 

All the code(s) that we implemented can be found in the appendix of the project report (project.pdf - We did not include the page in the project report that contains the repository link as submitted on Moodle.)

There are 8 such code snippets, each with its own importance as discussed in the code availability subsection of the project report (chapter 4, right before chapter 5).

The py file has all the python codes and coded in such a way that the output generated will be a pdf file and its output file is median_analysis_report.pdf.

Additionally, we have added a "Median of Two arrays Sorted calculator" (pro.py) , which inputs two arrays and returns the median of the two arrays. There are some steps that one must keep in mind while using the calculator: 

When you run this program, it initiates an interactive session that clearly guides you through the input process. The program first displays a welcome banner "=== Median of Two Sorted Arrays Calculator ===" and then prompts you to "Enter elements for Array A (space-separated):" where you can input any sequence of numbers like "1 3 5 7 9" or "2.5 4.8 6.2". After you press Enter, it immediately asks for "Enter elements for Array B (space-separated):" following the same format.

The program includes robust error handling that validates your input - if you accidentally enter non-numeric values like letters or special characters, it will display "Invalid input! Please enter numbers only." and exit gracefully. Once valid input is received, the program shows you the sorted versions of both arrays for verification, then proceeds to compute the median using both methods while measuring their performance. The final output clearly displays all results in a well-formatted table-like structure, making it easy to compare the outcomes and performance characteristics of both algorithmic approaches.
