Project Report (project.pdf) discusses in detail the logic behind the algorithm and its psuedocode with a visual representation. 
All the code(s) that we implemented can be found in the appendix of the project report (project.pdf - We did not include the page in the project report that contains the repository link as submitted on Moodle.)
There are 8 such code snippets, each with its own importance as discussed in the code availability subsection of the project report (chapter 4, right before chapter 5).
The py file has all the python codes and coded in such a way that the output generated will be a pdf file and its output file is median_analysis_report.pdf.
